# Galaxy-rs

An implementation of Voxtl's API in Rust.

Requires the `diesel_cli` cargo binary to run the database migrations (obviously). This project uses postgres specifically so you should install it with only that feature.

I'm dropping this for now because I don't have the time, if anyone wants to pick this up just message me or whatever.
